# WorldWide Telescope Miscellaneous Documentation

This book contains a variety of miscellaneous pieces of documentation relating
to the [AAS] [WorldWide Telescope]. The [GitBook] system that we use for
documentation requires one Git repository per book, and it feels a bit
overkill to create lots of repositories for short documents. So, this
repository collects those items.

You should never link directly to this top-level page â€” just link to the
specific chapter of interest.
