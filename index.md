# WorldWide Telescope Miscellaneous Documentation

This book contains a variety of miscellaneous pieces of documentation relating
to the [AAS] [WorldWide Telescope]. The [GitBook] system that we use for
documentation requires one Git repository per book, and it feels a bit
overkill to create lots of repositories for short documents. So, this
repository collects those items.

[AAS]: https://aas.org/
[WorldWide Telescope]: http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/
[GitBook]: https://docs.gitbook.com/

You should never link directly to this top-level page â€” just link to the
specific document of interest. These documents are, in no particular order:

- [GitBook Markdown Format Specification](./gitbook-spec.md)
- [Setting up a Windows VM for WWT Development](./windows-vm-setup.md)
